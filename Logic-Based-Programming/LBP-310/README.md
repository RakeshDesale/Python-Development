# Problem Statement:

Given a number n, for each integer i in the range from 1 to n inclusive, print one value per line as follows.<br>
=> if i is a multiple of both 3 and 5 print FizzBuzz<br>
=> if i is a multiple of 3 (but not 5), print Fizz<br>
=> if i is a multiple of 5 (but not 3), print Buzz<br>
=> if i is not a multiple of 3 or 5 print the value of i.<br>
