# Problem Statement:

Someone has attempted to censor my strings by replacing every vowel with a *, `l*k* th*s`. Luckily, I've been able to find the vowels that were removed.

Given a censored string and a string of the censored vowels, return the original uncensored string.

### Input Format

original & replacement strings

### Constraints

no

### Output Format

updated string after replacement

### Sample Input 0
```
w*lc*m*
eoe
```
### Sample Output 0
```
welcome
```
### Sample Input 1
```
Wh*r* d*d my v*w*ls g*?
eeioeo
```
### Sample Output 1
```
Where did my vowels go?
```
